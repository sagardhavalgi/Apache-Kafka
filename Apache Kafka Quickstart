# STEP 1: GET KAFKA
 tar -xzf kafka_2.13-3.4.0.tgz
 cd kafka_2.13-3.4.0

# START THE KAFKA ENVIRONMENT
# NOTE: Your local environment must have Java 8+ installed.
# Apache Kafka can be started using ZooKeeper
# Kafka with ZooKeeper
bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties

# Open another terminal session and run
bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties

# Once all services have successfully launched, you will have a basic Kafka environment running and ready to use.

# Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform that lets you read, write, store, and process events across many machines.
# So before you can write your first events, you must create a topic. Open another terminal session and run:
bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --topic quickstart-events --bootstrap-server localhost:9092

bin/kafka-topics.sh --describe --topic quickstart-events --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
Topic: quickstart-events        TopicId: NPmZHyhbR9y00wMglMH2sg PartitionCount: 1       ReplicationFactor: 1	Configs:
Topic: quickstart-events Partition: 0    Leader: 0   Replicas: 0 Isr: 0

# WRITE SOME EVENTS INTO THE TOPIC
bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --topic quickstart-events --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
This is my first event
This is my second event
# You can stop the producer client with Ctrl-C at any time.

# Open another terminal session and run the console consumer client to read the events you just created:
bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --topic quickstart-events --from-beginning --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
This is my first event
This is my second event

# TERMINATE THE KAFKA ENVIRONMENT
rm -rf /tmp/kafka-logs /tmp/zookeeper /tmp/kraft-combined-logs
